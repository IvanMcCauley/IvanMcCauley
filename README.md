# 👋 Hi, I'm Ivan McCauley  
### Mechatronics Engineer | Autonomous Systems | Embedded Intelligence

I’m a Mechatronics Engineering graduate focused on building **real-time autonomous systems** -where perception, control, and embedded logic meet.

My passion lies in **autonomous vehicles**, **robotics**, and **intelligent systems**. I’ve built lane detection pipelines, occupancy grid planners, real-time robots, and control simulations - all grounded in practical implementation, not just theory.

I care about systems that work under real-world constraints: vision in noisy dashcam footage, embedded logic on microcontrollers, and planning algorithms that respond in milliseconds.

Right now, I’m doubling down on **AV stack development** - especially in **perception, BEV mapping, and motion planning** - aiming to become a systems-level engineer in the autonomous driving space.
