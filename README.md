# 👋 Hi, I’m Ivan McCauley  
### Mechatronic Engineering Graduate | Autonomous Driving & ADAS Systems

I study autonomous driving **system behaviour** by building small-scale systems and simulations that explore the interaction of perception, decision logic, and safety constraints.

My work focuses on **decision-making near safety limits**, behavioural margins, and failure modes, using closed-loop evaluation to understand why a system chooses a particular action.

I’ve implemented braking decision pipelines, BEV-based planners, perception → planning demos on real dashcam data, and robotic control systems - with an consistent emphasis on **system behaviour rather than isolated algorithms**.

I’m currently seeking entry-level roles in **ADAS / autonomous driving** in **systems engineering / integration**, with a focus on feature behaviour, interfaces, and failure-mode robustness.
