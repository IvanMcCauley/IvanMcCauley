# 👋 Hi, I'm Ivan McCauley  
### Mechatronics Engineer | Robotics | Embedded Systems

I’m a Mechatronics Engineering graduate focused on autonomous vehicles, robotics, and intelligent systems. I’ve been building hands-on systems where hardware, embedded logic, control, and perception all come together in real time.

I’ve designed autonomous robots, developed control systems in MATLAB/Simulink, and built perception and planning pipelines using Python. What drives me is building systems that actually function, not just in theory, but under real-world constraints.

Right now I’m doubling down on learning about AV systems, especially perception, planning, and control integration, with the goal of becoming a systems-level engineer in the autonomous driving space.
