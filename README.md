# 👋 Hi, I'm Ivan McCauley  
### Mechatronics Engineer | Robotics | Embedded Systems

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering graduate with a passion for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent systems. I enjoy working at the intersection of software and hardware, where embedded systems meet machine learning, and control theory becomes real-world motion.

Throughout my degree, I designed autonomous robots, programmed microcontrollers, and built hardware-software systems using Python, C++, and MATLAB. I'm driven by building things that *actually work*, and I'm currently diving deeper into control systems and perception for autonomous vehicles as it's my goal to specialize in this field.
