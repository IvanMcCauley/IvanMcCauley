# 👋 Hi, I'm Ivan McCauley  
### Mechatronics Engineer | ADAS & Autonomous Systems | Embedded Intelligence  

I'm a Mechatronic Engineering graduate focused on building **real-time autonomous systems**: from perception to control.  
My passion lies in **autonomous vehicles**, **robotics**, and **intelligent systems**.  

I’ve built lane detection pipelines, occupancy-grid planners, ROS 2 braking systems, real-time robots, and control simulations.  

Right now, I’m doubling down on **AV stack development** - especially in **perception, BEV mapping, motion planning, and ROS 2 systems integration** - aiming to become a systems-level engineer in the autonomous driving space.

🔧 **Tech Stack**  
- **Languages:** Python, C++, MATLAB  
- **Tools:** ROS 2, OpenCV, Simulink, Git, Arduino IDE, MPLAB X  
- **Domains:** ADAS/AV, Path Planning, Robotics, Control Systems, Embedded  
- **Currently Exploring:** Sensor Fusion, Kalman Filters, Advanced ROS 2 patterns, AV safety standards (ISO 26262, SOTIF)
